Create a list with events/appointments/concerts/future happenings and show them on your site. Includes optional widget and advanced page options.

== Description ==

The plugin features a straightforward user interface in the Wordpress dashboard to add/edit and delete events and set some options. 
Events allows you to list Events on a seperate page or in the sidebar, or both. Here you can list Old (archived) events future events and if you want, events happening today.
When you create or edit an event you can set it to be archived. So that it remains listed. Optionally non-archived events are automatically deleted one day (24 hours) after they expire. Many more options are available and Events is completely customizable to your theme in an easy and flexible manner.

== Usage ==

= Show a list of events on a page (default) =

Create a new page.
To show just events put in the page field:
`[events_show] OR [events_show type="default"]`
To also show the archive, put in the page field:
`[events_show type="archive"]`
And to show todays Events, put in the page field:
`[events_show type="today"]`
Or to show a weeks worth of Events, put in the page field:
`[events_show type="week"]`
Save the page.

= Customized lists (advanced) =

Show a specific category:
`[events_show category="2"]`
Show a specific event:
`[events_show type="default" event="9"]`
To show just 2 events on your page use:
`[events_show type="today" amount="2"]`
To also show override the sort order:
`[events_show type="default" order="thetime ASC"]`
Or a combination:
`[events_show type="archive" amount="15" order="ID ASC"]`
Note: For the ëorderí field review the table and use a table field name and ASC (ascending) DESC (descending), make no mistake here!

= Sidebar =

For the sidebar you can use the widget. This can be found in your dashboard under appearance. Or you can use PHP to implement the widget manually.

= Some examples =
`echo events_sidebar();`

And some useful variations and options
`echo events_sidebar(5, 2); /* Show 5 events from category 2 */`
`echo events_sidebar('', 3); /* No amount override but show category 3 */`
`echo events_sidebar(8); /* Show 8 events */`
`echo events_sidebar(6, ''); /* Show 6 events */`
