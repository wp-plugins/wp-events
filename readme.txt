Create a list with events/appointments/concerts/future happenings and show them on your site.

== Description ==

The plugin features a straightforward user interface in the Wordpress dashboard to add/edit and delete events and set some options. 
Events allows you to list Events on a seperate page or in the sidebar, or both. Here you can list Old (archived) events future events and if you want, events happening today.
When you create or edit an event you can set it to be archived. So that it remains listed. Optionally non-archived events are automatically deleted one day (24 hours) after they expire. Many more options are available and Events is completely customizable to your theme in an easy and flexible manner.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q:** Is it safe to use the automatic upgrade?

**A:** By default no! Not for any plugin. 
In specifics, Events sometimes receives a new version of the database and thus cannot automatically upgrade, some things are to be done manually for your own safety!
